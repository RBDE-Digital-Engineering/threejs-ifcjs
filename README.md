# IFC-Inspector

This app provides a proof of concept for exploring 3D Models and interactively creating new Propertysets and BCF Files for Documentation/Data quality.
It currently instantly creates both an IFC File with an added Propertyset and a BCF File linked to the clicked object with a default remark.

Further work will extend the popup modal to include forms to enter information.
